Changelog
=========

This change log is managed by `scripts/cmds/update-versions` but may be manually updated.
During the v1-ALPHA, although attempts are made to minimize it, some of the APIs
may change. It is generally recommended that you remove your `node_modules/`,
`package-lock.json` (and similar files for yarn, etc.) and doing an `npm install`
after upgrading to a newer version of the v1-ALPHA.
